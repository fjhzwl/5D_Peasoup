# template_bank_gpu
C++ Cuda GPU Pulsar Search Pipeline using the template-bank algorithm. This pipeline was built on the original code written almost entirely by Ewan Barr (MPIfR). You can find the original repo here that does an 1-D acceleration search. https://github.com/ewanbarr/peasoup

This pipeline does a coherent search for circular and elliptical binary orbits (3 or 5 binary parameters) using the Random/Stochastic Template-Bank algorithm. You can read more about this algorithm in Messenger (2008), Harry (2009), Knispel (2011) and Allen (2013).
